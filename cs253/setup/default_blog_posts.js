`Hanging in form before the storm, A hero has been born.
Shadowed retrieve, scaling the walls as they flutter, cry and revolve.
Upon leaving the cave, they flap and wave until they cover the sky.
Once slipped into the mist, A bright signal sings a victims cry!

"We need you, Our Dark Knight!"

Spinning and burning, sceaming and turning. The batmobile is on it's way.
Thundering through Gotham's dark streets, Batmans here to save the day!

Giggles and squeals. Joker's got wheels and Harley's playing Bat.
Riddles got the question and Boogie's brought some psychopathes.
A bus full of Villians, So careless and worry free. Trifle through the crooked city.

Suddenly a blast of exasperated air. Seems a sharpened blade has left each tire in disrepair.
Spun out, Flipped up, with a crashing boom. Gotham City's bad guys' will be back in Arkham soon.

Rumbling through the wreckage, with all the Villians worn.`;

`Sky-borne boots touch down
on unfamiliar ground.
Wind-worn cape detached
from low-slung shoulders.
 
An iconic suit suffocates,
trapping shreds of humanity.
Shedding his skin,
an identity is cast aside.
 
A symbol of hope
dims in colour, draining into a puddle of murk.
When the world rests on your shoulders
there's no time to scratch an itch.
 
Kryptonite dreams smother void strength.
Fear for a home not his,
stricken by memories of a home not known.
A million burdens in the mind of a man.
 
The unwary bird flies without care,`;

`Spiderman, Spiderman, 
Does whatever a spider can 
Spins a web, any size, 
Catches thieves just like flies 
Look Out! 
Here comes the Spiderman. 

Is he strong? 
Listen bud, 
He's got radioactive blood. 
Can he swing from a thread 
Take a look overhead 
Hey, there 
There goes the Spiderman. 

In the chill of night 
At the scene of a crime 
Like a streak of light 
He arrives just in time. 

Spiderman, Spiderman 
Friendly neighborhood Spiderman 
Wealth and fame 
He's ignored 
Action is his reward. 

To him, life is a great big bang up 
Wherever there's a hang up 
You'll find the Spider man.`;
